The supreme law of the State is self-preservation at any cost. And since all States, ever since they came to exist upon the earth, have been condemned to perpetual struggle  a struggle against their own populations, whom they oppress and ruin, a struggle against all foreign States, every one of which can be strong only if the others are weak  and since the States cannot hold their own in this struggle unless they constantly keep on augmenting their power against their own subjects as well as against the neighborhood States  it follows that the supreme law of the State is the augmentation of its power to the detriment of internal liberty and external justice.

The idea of humanity becomes more and more of a power in the civilized world, and, owing to the expansion and increasing speed of means of communication, and also owing to the influence, still more material than moral, of civilization upon barbarous peoples, this idea of humanity begins to take hold even of the minds of uncivilized nations. This idea is the invisible power of our century, with which the present powers  the States  must reckon. They cannot submit to it of their own free will because such submission on their part would be equivalent to suicide, since the triumph of humanity can be realized only through the destruction of the States. But the States can no longer deny this idea nor openly rebel against it, for having now grown too strong, it may finally destroy them.

In the face of this fainful alternative there remains only one way out: and that is hypocrisy. The States pay their outward respects to this idea of humanity; they speak and apparently act only in the name of it, but they violate it every day. This, however, should not be held against the States. They cannot act otherwise, their position having become such that they can hold their own only by lying. Diplomacy has no other mission.

Therefore what do we see? Every time a State wants to declare war upon another State, it starts off by launching a manifesto addressed not only to its own subjects but to the whole world. In this manifesto it declares that right and justice are on its side, and it endeavors to prove that it is actuated only by love of peace and humanity and that, imbued with generous and peaceful sentiments, it suffered for a long time in silence until the mounting iniquity of its enemy forced it to bare its sword. At the same time it vows that, disdainful of all material conquest and not seeking any increase in territory, it will put and end to this war as soon as justice is reestablished. And its antagonist answers with a similar manifesto, in which naturally right, justice, humanity, and all the generous sentiments are to be found respectively on its side.

Those mutually opposed manifestos are written with the same eloquence, they breathe the same virtuous indignation, and one is just as sincere as the other; that is to say both of them are equally brazen in their lies, and it is only fools who are deceived by them. Sensible persons, all those who have had some political experience, do not even take the trouble of reading such manifestos. On the contrary, they seek ways to uncover the interests driving both adversaries into this war, and to weigh the respective power of each of them in order to guess the outcome of the struggle. Which only goes to prove that moral issues are not at stake in such wars.

En el fondo, la conquista no slo es el origen, es tambin el fin supremo de todos los Estados grandes o pequeos, poderosos o dbiles, despticos o liberales, monrquicos o aristocrticos, democrticos y socialistas tambin, suponiendo que el ideal de los socialistas alemanes, el de un gran Estado comunista, se realice alguna vez.

Que ella fue el punto de partida de todos los Estados, antiguos y modernos, no podr ser puesto en duda por nadie, puesto que cada pgina de la historia universal lo prueba suficientemente. Nadie negar tampoco que los grandes Estados actuales tienen por objeto, ms o menos confesado, la conquista. Pero los Estados medianos y sobre todo los pequeos, se dir, no piensan ms que en defenderse y sera ridculo por su parte soar en la conquista.

Todo lo ridculo que se quiera, pero sin embargo es su sueo, como el sueo del ms pequeo campesino propietario es redondear sus tierras en detrimento del vecino; redondearse, crecer, conquistar a cualquier precio y siempre, es una tendencia fatalmente inherente a todo Estado, cualquiera que sea su extensin, su debilidad o su fuerza, porque es una necesidad de su naturaleza. Qu es el Estado si no es la organizacin del poder? Pero est en la naturaleza de todo poder la imposibilidad de soportar un superior o un igual, pues el poder no tiene otro objeto que la dominacin, y la dominacin no es real ms que cuando le est sometido todo lo que la obstaculiza; ningn poder tolera otro ms que cuando est obligado a ello, es decir, cuando se siente impotente para destruirlo o derribarlo. El solo hecho de un poder igual es una negacin de su principio y una amenaza perpetua contra su existencia; porque es una manifestacin y una prueba de su impotencia. Por consiguiente, entre todos los Estados que existen uno junto al otro, la guerra es permanente y su paz no es ms que una tregua.

Est en la naturaleza del Estado el presentarse tanto con relacin a s mismo como frente a sus sbditos, como el objeto absoluto. Servir a su prosperidad, a su grandeza, a su poder, esa es la virtud suprema del patriotismo. El Estado no reconoce otra, todo lo que le sirve es bueno, todo lo que es contrario a sus intereses es declarado criminal; tal es la moral de los Estados.

Es por eso que la moral poltica ha sido en todo tiempo, no slo extraa, sino absolutamente contraria a la moral humana. Esa contradiccin es una consecuencia inevitable de su principio: no siendo el Estado ms que una parte, se coloca y se impone como el todo; ignora el derecho de todo lo que, no siendo l mismo, se encuentra fuera de l, y cuando puede, sin peligro, lo viola. El Estado es la negacin de la humanidad.

Thus, as I have already observed, materialism starts from animality to establish humanity; idealism starts from divinity to establish slavery and condemn the masses to an endless animality. Materialism denies free will and ends in the establishment of liberty; idealism, in the name of human dignity, proclaims free will, and on the ruins of every liberty founds authority. Materialism rejects the principle of authority, because it rightly considers it as the corollary of animality, and because, on the contrary, the triumph of humanity, the object and chief significance of history, can be realised only through liberty. In a word, you will always find the idealists in the very act of practical materialism, while you will see the materialists pursuing and realising the most grandly ideal aspirations and thoughts.

El hombre, en tanto que individuo animal, como los animales de todas las otras especies, desde el principio y desde que comienza a respirar, tiene el sentimiento inmediato de su existencia individual; pero no adquiere la conciencia reflexiva de si, conciencia que constituye propiamente su personalidad, ms que por medio de la inteligencia, y por consiguiente slo en la sociedad. Vuestra personalidad ms ntima, la conciencia que tenis de vosotros mismos en vuestro fuero interno, no es en cierto modo ms que el reflejo de vuestra propia imagen, repercutida y enviada de nuevo como por otros tantos espejos por la conciencia tanto colectiva como individual de todos los seres humanos que componen vuestro mundo social. Cada hombre que conocis y con el cual os hallis en relaciones, sean directas sean indirectas, determina ms o menos vuestro ser ms ntimo, contribuye a haceros lo que sois, a constituir vuestra personalidad. Por consiguiente, si estis rodeados de esclavos, aunque seis su amo, no dejis de ser un esclavo, pues la conciencia de los esclavos no puede enviaros sino vuestra imagen envilecida. La imbecilidad de todos os imbeciliza, mientras que la inteligencia de todos os ilumina, os eleva; los vicios de vuestro medio social son vuestros vicios y no podrais ser hombres realmente libres sin estar rodeados de hombres igualmente libres, pues la existencia de un solo esclavo basta para aminorar vuestra libertad.

La Biblia, que es un libro muy interesante y a veces muy profundo cuando se lo considera como una de las ms antiguas manifestaciones de la sabidura y de la fantasa humanas que han llegado hasta nosotros, expresa esta verdad de una manera muy ingenua en su mito del pecado original.

Les haba prohibido expresamente que tocaran los frutos del rbol de la ciencia.

We have already observed that by excluding the immense majority of the human species from its midst, by keeping this majority outside the reciprocal engagements and duties of morality, of justice, and of right, the State denies humanity and, using that sonorous word patriotism, imposes injustice and cruelty as a supreme duty upon all its subjects. It restricts, it mutilates, it kills humanity in them, so that by ceasing to be men, they may be solely citizensor rather, and more specifically, that through the historic connection and succession of facts, they may never rise above the citizen to the height of being man We have also seen that every state, under pain of destruction and fearing to be devoured by its neighbor states, must reach out toward omnipotence, and, having become powerful, must conquer.

Slavery may change its form or its nameits essence remains the same. Its essence may be expressed in these words: to be a slave is to he forced to work for someone else, just as to he a master is to live on someone else's work In antiquity, just as in Asia and in Africa today, as well as even in a part of America, slaves were, in all honesty, called slaves. In the Middle Ages, they took the name of serfs: nowadays they are called wage earners. The position of tins latter group has a great deal more dignity attached to it, and it is less hard than that of slaves, but they are nonetheless forced, by hunger as well as by political and social institutions, to maintain other people in complete or relative idleness, through their own exceedingly hard labor. Consequently they arc slaves. And in general, no state, ancient or modern, has ever managed or will ever manage to get along without the forced labor of the masses, either wage earners or slaves, as a principal and absolutely necessary foundation for the leisure, the liberty, and the civilization of the political classthe citizens.

Que no se objete que el cristianismo ordena a los nios a amar a sus padres, a los padres a amar a sus hijos, a los esposos a feccionarse mutuamente. S, les manda eso, pero no les permite amarlo inmediata, naturalmente y por s mismos, sino slo en dios y por dios; no admite todas esas relaciones actuales ms que a condicin de que dios se encuentre como tercero, y ese terrible tercero mata las uniones. El amor divino aniquila el amor humano. El cristianismo ordena, es verdad, amar a nuestro prjimo tanto como a nosotros mismos, pero nos ordena al mismo tiempo amar a dios ms que a nosotros mismos y por consiguiente tambin ms que al prjimo, es decir sacrificarle el prjimo por nuestra salvacin, porque al fin de cuentas el cristiano no adora a dios ms que por la salvacin de su alma.

Aceptando a dios, todo eso es rigurosamente consecuente: dios es lo infinito, lo absoluto, lo eterno, lo omnipotente; el hombre es lo finito, lo impotente. En comparacin con dios, bajo todos los aspectos, no es nada. Slo lo divino es justo, verdadero, dichoso y bueno, y todo lo que es humano en el hombre debe ser por eso mismo declarado falso, inicuo, detestable y miserable. El contacto de la divinidad con esa pobre humanidad debe devorar, pues, necesariamente, consumir, aniquilar todo lo que queda de humano en los hombres.

La intervencin divina en los asuntos humanos no ha dejado nunca de producir efectos excesivamente desastrosos. Pervierte todas las relaciones de los hombres entre s y reemplaza su solidaridad natural por la prctica hipcrita y malsana de las comunidades religiosas, en las que bajo las apariencias de la caridad, cada cual piensa slo en la salvacin de su alma, haciendo as, bajo el pretexto del amor divino, egosmo humano excesivamente refinado, lleno de ternura para s y de indiferencia, de malevolencia y hasta de crueldad para el prjimo.

In the matter of boots, I defer to the authority of the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult the architect or the engineer For such special knowledge I apply to such a "savant." But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor the "savant" to impose his authority on me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions and choose that which seems to me soundest. But I recognize no infallible authority, even m special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person.

La contradiccin es sta: quieren a Dios y quieren a la humanidad. Se obstinan en poner juntos esos dos trminos, que, una vez separados, no pueden encontrarse de nuevo ms que para destruirse recprocamente. Dicen de un tirn: Dios y la libertad del hombre; Dios y la dignidad, la justicia, la igualdad, la fraternidad y la prosperidad de los hombres, sin preocuparse de la lgica fatal conforme a la cual, si Dios existe todo queda condenado a la no-existencia. Porque si Dios existe es necesariamente el amo eterno, supremo, absoluto, y si amo existe el hombre es esclavo; pero si es esclavo, no hay para l ni justicia ni igualdad ni fraternidad ni prosperidad posibles. Podrn, contrariamente al buen sentido y a todas las experiencias de la historia, reventarse a su Dios animado del ms tierno amor por la libertad humana: un amo, haga lo que quiera y por liberal que quiera mostrarse, no deja de ser un amo y su existencia implica necesariamente la esclavitud de todo lo que se encuentra por debajo de l.

Por consiguiente, si Dios existiese, no habra para l ms que un solo medio de servir a la libertad humana: dejar de existir.

Como celoso amante de la libertad humana y considerndolo como la condicin absoluta de todo lo que adoramos y respetamos en la humanidad, doy vuelta a la frase de Voltaire y digo: si Dios existiese realmente, habra que hacerlo desaparecer.

Henos aqu de nuevo en la iglesia y en el Estado. Es verdad que en esa organizacin nueva, establecida, como todas las organizaciones polticas antiguas, por la gracia de Dios, pero apoyada esta vez, al menos en la forma, a guisa de concesin necesaria al espritu moderno, y como en los prembulos de los decretos imperiales de Napolen III, sobre la voluntad (ficticia) del pueblo; la iglesia no se llamar ya iglesia, se llamar escuela. Pero sobre los bancos de esa escuela no se sentarn solamente los nios: estar el menor eterno, el escolar reconocido incapaz para siempre de sufrir sus exmenes, de elevarse a la ciencia de sus maestros y de pasarse sin su disciplina: el pueblo. El Estado no se llamar ya monarqua, se llamar repblica, pero no dejar de ser Estado, es decir, una tutela oficial y relarmente establecida por una minora de hombres competentes, de hombres de genio o de talento, virtuosos, para vigilar y para dirigir la conducta de ese gran incorregible y nio terrible: el Pueblo. Los profesores de la escuela y los funcionarios del Estado se harn republicanos; pero no sern por eso menos tutores, pastores, y el pueblo permanecer siendo lo que ha sido eternamente hasta aqu: un rebao. Cuidado entonces con los esquiladores; porque all donde hay un rebao, habr necesariamente tambin esquiladores y aprovechadores del rebao.

El pueblo, en ese sistema, ser el escolar y el pupilo eterno. A pesar de su soberana completamente ficticia, continuar sirviendo de instrumento a pensamientos, a voluntades y por consiguiente tambin a intereses que no sern los suyos. Entre esta situacin y la que llamamos de libertad, de verdadera libertad, hay un abismo. Habr, bajo formas nuevas, la antigua opresin y la antigua esclavitud, y all donde existe la esclavitud, estn la miseria, el embrutecimiento, la verdadera materializacin de la sociedad, tanto de las clases privilegiadas, como de las masas.

Representative democracy, however, harmonizes marvelously with the capitalist economic system. This new statist system, basing itself on the alleged sovereignty of the so-called will of the people, as supposedly expressed by their alleged representatives in mock popular assemblies, incorporates the two principal and necessary conditions for the progress of capitalism: state centralization, and the actual submission of the sovereign people to the intellectual governing minority, who, while claiming to represent the people, unfailingly exploits them.

Hay una categora de gentes que, si no cree, debe menos aparentar que cree. Son todos los atormentadores, todos los opresores y todos los explotadores de la humanidad. Sacerdotes, monarcas, hombres de Estado, hombres de guerra, financistas pblicos y privados, funcionarios de todas las especies, policas, carceleros y verdugos, monopolizadores, capitalistas, empresarios y propietarios, abogados, economistas, polticos de todos los colores, hasta el ltimo comerciante, todos repetirn al unsono estas palabras de Voltaire: "Si Dios no existiese habra que inventario." Porque, comprenderis, es precisa una religin para el pueblo. Es la vlvula de seguridad.

Existe, en fin, una categora bastante numerosa de almas honestas, pero dbiles, que, demasiado inteligentes para tomar en serio los dogmas cristianos, los rechazan en detalle, pero no tienen ni el valor, ni la fuerza, ni la resolucin necesarios para rechazarlos totalmente. Dejan a vuestra crtica todos los absurdos particulares de la religin, se burlan de todos los milagros, pero se aferran con desesperacin al absurdo principal, fuente de todos los dems, al milagro que explica y legitima todos los otros milagros: a la existencia de Dios. Su Dios no es el ser vigoroso y potente, el Dios brutalmente positivo de la teologa. Es un ser nebuloso, difano, ilusorio, de tal modo ilusorio que cuando se cree palparle se transforma en Nada; es un milagro, un ignis fatuus que ni calienta ni ilumina. Y, sin embargo, sostienen y creen que si desapareciese, desaparecera todo con l. Son almas inciertas, enfermizas, desorientadas en la civilizacin actual, que no pertenecen ni al presente ni al porvenir, plidos fantasmas eternamente suspendidos entre el cielo y la tierra, y que ocupan entre la poltica burguesa y el socialismo del proletariado absolutamente la misma posicin. No se sienten con fuerza ni para pensar hasta el fin, ni para querer, ni para resolver, y pierden su tiempo y su labor esforzndose siempre por conciliar lo inconciliable. En la vida pblica se llaman socialistas burgueses.

Ninguna discusin con ellos ni contra ellos es posible. Estn demasiado enfermos.

"When we speak of prayer or of the results of prayer we always imply only one kind of prayer — petition or we think that petition can be united with all other kinds of prayers.… Most prayers have nothing in common with petitions. I speak of ancient prayers; many of them are much older than Christianity. These prayers are, so to speak, recapitulations; by repeating them aloud or to himself a man endeavors to experience what is in them, their whole content, with his mind and his feeling."

"Objective knowledge, the idea of unity included, belongs to objective consciousness. The forms which express this knowledge when perceived by subjective consciousness are inevitably distorted and, instead of truth, they create more and more delusions. With objective consciousness it is possible to see and feel the unity of everything. But for subjective consciousness the world is split up into millions of separate and unconnected phenomena. Attempts to connect these phenomena into some sort of system in a scientific or philosophical way lead to nothing because man cannot reconstruct the idea of the whole starting from separate facts and they cannot divine the principles of the division of the whole without knowing the laws upon which this division is based."

"A man can keep silence in such a way that no one will even notice it. The whole point is that we say a good deal too much. If we limited ourselves to what is actually necessary, this alone would be keeping the silence. And it is the same with everything else, with food, with pleasures, with sleep; with everything there is a limit to what is necessary. After this 'sin' begins. This is something that must be grasped, a 'sin' is something which is not necessary."

"RELIGION IS DOING; a man does not merely think his religion or feel it, he lives his religion as much as he is able, otherwise it is not religion but fantasy or philosophy. Whether he likes it or not he shows his attitude towards religion by his actions and he can show his attitude only by his actions. Therefore if his actions are opposed to those which are demanded by a given religion he cannot assert that he belongs to that religion."

"The advantage of the separate individual is that he is very small and that, in the economy of Nature, it makes no difference whether there is one mechanical man more or less. We can easily understand this correlation of magnitudes if we imagine the correlation between a microscopic cell and our own body. The presence or absence of one cell will change nothing in the life of the body. We cannot be conscious of it, and it can have no influence on the life and functions of the organism. In exactly the same way a separate individual is too small to influence the life of the cosmic organism to which he stands in the same relation (with regard to size) as a cell stands to our own organism. And this is precisely what makes his 'evolution' possible; on this are based his 'possibilities'."

"There do exist enquiring minds, which long for the truth of the heart, seek it, strive to solve the problems set by life, try to penetrate to the essence of things and phenomena and to penetrate into themselves. If a man reasons and thinks soundly, no matter which path he follows in solving these problems, he must inevitably arrive back at himself, and begin with the solution of the problem of what he is himself and what his place is in the world around him. For without this knowledge, he will have no focal point in his search. Socrates’ words, “Know thyself” remain for all those who seek true knowledge and being."

"LIBERATION LEADS TO LIBERATION. These are the first words of truth — not truth in quotation marks but truth in the real meaning of the word; truth which is not merely theoretical, not simply a word, but truth that can be realized in practice. The meaning behind these words may be explained as follows: By liberation is meant the liberation which is the aim of all schools, all religions, at all times. This liberation can indeed be very great. All men desire it and strive after it. But it cannot be attained without the first liberation, a lesser liberation. The great liberation is liberation from influences outside us. The lesser liberation is liberation from influences within us."

If a man could understand all the horror of the lives of ordinary people who are turning around in a circle of insignificant interests and insignificant aims, if he could understand what they are losing, he would understand that there can only be one thing that is serious for him - to escape from the general law, to be free. What can be serious for a man in prison who is condemned to death? Only one thing: How to save himself, how to escape: nothing else is serious.

One may say that evil does not exist for subjective man at all, that there exist only different conceptions of good.

There do exist enquiring minds, which long for the truth of the heart, seek it, strive to solve the problems set by life, try to penetrate to the essence of things and phenomena and to penetrate into themselves. If a man reasons and thinks soundly, no matter which path he follows in solving these problems, he must inevitably arrive back at himself, and begin with the solution of the problem of what he is himself and what his place is in the world around him.

Sincerity is the key which will open the door through which you will see your separate parts, and you will see something quite new. You must go on trying to be sincere. Each day you put on a mask, and you must take it off little by little.

If a sufficient number of people who wanted to stop war really did gather together, they would first of all begin by making war upon those who disagreed with them. And it is still more certain that they would make war on people who also want to stop wars but in another way.

One twentieth of all our energy goes to emotional and instinctive centres.  Self-remembering is a lamp which must be kept alight by energy from these two centres.  Our thinking centre is not really a centre, but an apparatus for collecting impressions.

Formatory apparatus resembles a hired typist who works for a firm and has a large number of stereotyped replies for external impressions.  She sends printed replies to other centres who are the ‘directors’ of the firm and who are strangers to each other.  Wrong replies are often sent, as the typist is asleep or lazy.

An ordinary man has no ‘Master.’  He is ruled now by the mind, now by the feelings and now by the body.  Often the order comes from the automatic apparatus and still more often he is ordered about by the sex centre.  Real will can only be when one ‘I’ rules, when there is a ‘master’ in the house.

Morality is a stick with two ends; it can be turned this way and that.
― George Gurdjieff
%
From the time when man began to live on the Earth, from the time of Adam onwards, there started to be formed within him, with the help of God, of Nature, and of all his surroundings, an organ whose function is conscience.  Every man has this organ, and whoever is guided by it automatically lives according to God’s commandments.  If our consciences were clear, and not buried, there would be no need to speak about morality, for consciously or unconsciously everyone would behave according to God’s commandments.  Unfortunately conscience is covered up with a kind of crust which can be pierced only by intense suffering; then conscience speaks.  But after a while a man calms down and once more the organ becomes covered over and buried.
