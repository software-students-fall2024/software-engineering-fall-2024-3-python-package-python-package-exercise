## Contributing

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/3-python-package-codecrafter
   ```


2. **Install pipenv if you haven't already:**

   ```bash
   pip install pipenv
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

### Building and Testing

- **Run Tests:**

  We use `pytest` for testing.

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- **Build Package:**

  Use `build` to create the package artifacts.

  ```bash
  python -m build
  ```

- **Upload to PyPI (For maintainers):**

  Use `twine` to upload the package.

  ```bash
  twine upload dist/*
  ```

### Git Workflow

All code changes must be done in feature branches and not directly in the `main` branch.

To merge code from a feature branch into `main`:

1. **Create a pull request** from the feature branch to `main`.
2. **Request a code review** from a team member.
3. **Review and approve** the code after ensuring all tests pass.
4. **Merge the pull request** into `main`.
5. **Delete the feature branch**.

**Note:** Regularly merge feature branches to avoid merge conflicts.
