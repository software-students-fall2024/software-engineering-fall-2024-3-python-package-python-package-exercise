# Python Package Exercise

An exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Installation

Install the `pyexcuses` module with pip:

```console
pip3 install pyexcuses
```

If you want to look at all the functions, make your way to the [example program](./showcase_usage.py), which shows you how to use each function in `pyexcuses`.

### Python

Access the **excuses** in your own project by importing `pyexcuses` and using the function
`generate_excuse`:

```pycon
>>> import pyexcuses
>>> print(pyexcuses.generate_excuse())
It works on my machine, but maybe the server environment is different.
```

We can use spoken languages for English and Spanish, and we have excuses for different programming languages:

```pycon
>>> import pyexcuses
>>> print(pyexcuses.generate_excuse("es"))  # spanish excuse
Funciona en mi máquina, pero quizás el entorno del servidor sea diferente
>>> print(pyexcuses.generate_excuse("es", "javascript"))  # spanish excuse for javascript programming language
El CSS está luchando con JavaScript de nuevo.
```

Access the **solutions** in your own project by importing `pyexcuses` and using the function
`suggest_solution`:

```pycon
>>> import pyexcuses
>>> print(pyexcuses.suggest_solution())
Try running it on a Friday—bugs don't like weekends.
```

We also have solutions for different spoken languages and programming languages:

```pycon
>>> import pyexcuses
>>> print(pyexcuses.suggest_solution("es"))  # spanish solution
"¿Has probado a añadir más comentarios a tu código?
>>> print(pyexcuses.suggest_solution("es", "javascript"))  # spanish solution for javascript programming language
¿Has probado a añadir más puntos y comas? A JavaScript le encantan.
```

We have a `list_available_options` function that lets you check which languages (spoken or programming) are supported by the package.

```pycon
>>> import pyexcuses
>>> print(pyexcuses.list_available_options("spoken_language")) # print all spoken langs
['en', 'es']
>>> print(pyexcuses.list_available_options("programming_language")) # print all programming langs
['python', 'javascript', 'neutral']

Finally, the get_multilingual_excuse_or_solution function provides an excuse or solution in both English and Spanish for any given programming language. 

```pycon
>>> import pyexcuses
>>> print(pyexcuses.get_multilingual_excuse_or_solution("excuse", "python")) # get both spanish and english
'en': 'It works on my machine.',
'es': 'Funciona en mi máquina.'

# Get a multilingual solution in English and Spanish for JavaScript
solution = pyexcuses.get_multilingual_excuse_or_solution("solution", "javascript")
print(solution)
# Output:
# {
#    'en': 'Have you tried clearing the cache?',
#    'es': '¿Has probado a limpiar la caché?'
# }
