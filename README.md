- **Returns:**
  - A string containing the riddle's question.

- **Example:**

  ```python
  import riddle_handler

  # Generate a riddle of difficulty level 2

  print(f"Here's your riddle: {riddle}")
  ```

#### Function 2: `check_answer(riddle_id: int, answer: str) -> str`

Checks if the provided answer to the riddle is correct.

- **Parameters:**
  - `riddle_id` (int): The ID of the riddle.
  - `answer` (str): The user's answer to the riddle.

- **Returns:**
  - A string indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

- **Example:**

  ```python

  print(result)  # Outputs: "Correct answer!" or "Incorrect answer. Try again!"
  ```

#### Function 3: `submit_riddle(riddle: dict) -> str`

Allows users to submit their own riddles to the library.

- **Parameters:**
  - `riddle` (dict): A dictionary containing the riddle's details.

    - `question` (str): The riddle's question.

  - A string indicating success or an error message.

- **Example:**

  ```python
  import riddle_handler

  # Define your custom riddle
  my_riddle = {

        "hint": "You can hear me but cannot see me.",
        "difficulty": 3,
        "topic": "Communication"
  }

  # Submit the riddle
  response = riddle_handler.submit_riddle(my_riddle)
  print(response)  # Outputs: "Riddle submitted successfully!"
  ```

#### Function 4: `provide_hint(riddle_id: int) -> str`

Provides a hint for the specified riddle.

- **Parameters:**
  - `riddle_id` (int): The ID of the riddle.

- **Returns:**
  - A string containing the hint or an error message.

- **Example:**

  ```python
  import riddle_handler

  # Get a hint for a riddle
  hint = riddle_handler.provide_hint(5)
  print(hint)  # Outputs the hint for the riddle
  ```

## Contributing

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/3-python-package-codecrafter
   ```

2. **Install `pipenv`:**

If you havenâ€™t installed `pipenv` yet, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

3. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**

To create a virtual environment and install dependencies using the `Pipfile`, run:

```bash
pipenv install
```

This command will read the `Pipfile` and create a virtual environment with all the specified dependencies.

If you only want to create the environment without installing dependencies, you can use:

```bash
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

To activate the virtual environment, use:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

This command works on both Mac and Windows, as `pipenv` will automatically locate and activate the correct environment.

5. **Install Additional Dependencies(If Needed):**

If you need to add more dependencies later, you can use the following commands:

- For production dependencies:

  ```bash
  pipenv install <package-name>
  ```

- For development dependencies (e.g., testing or debugging tools):

  ```bash
  pipenv install --dev <package-name>
  ```

6. **Exit the Virtual Environment:**

To exit the virtual environment, simply type:

```bash
exit
```

Or press `Ctrl + D`.

7. **Remove the Virtual Environmen:**

If you need to delete the virtual environment, use:

```bash
pipenv --rm
```

This will remove the virtual environment associated with the `Pipfile`.


### Building and Testing

- **Run Tests:**

  We use `pytest` for testing.

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

- **Build Package:**

  Use `build` to create the package artifacts.
  
  For Mac:


  ```bash
  python3 -m build
  ```

  For Windows:


  ```bash
  python -m build
  ```

- **Upload to PyPI (For maintainers):**

  Use `twine` to upload the package.

  ```bash
  twine upload dist/*
  ```

  Note that API key should only be acquired by contacting administrators

### Git Workflow

All code changes must be done in feature branches and not directly in the `main` branch.

To merge code from a feature branch into `main`:

1. **Create a pull request** from the feature branch to `main`.
2. **Request a code review** from a team member.
3. **Review and approve** the code after ensuring all tests pass.
4. **Merge the pull request** into `main`.
5. **Delete the feature branch**.

**Note:** Regularly merge feature branches to avoid merge conflicts.

## Configuration and Setup

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic usage.

### Importing Starter Data

**The package uses a `riddleLibrary.json` file to store riddles. Ensure that this file is in the root directory of your project. You can use our library from [this link](https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/3-python-package-codecrafter/blob/main/riddleLibrary.json) or you can build your own by creating a `riddleLibrary.json` file.**
