# Funky Fortune

This package is designed for those who enjoy divination and fortune telling. Tools include a magic eight ball, fortune cookies, zodiac fortunes, and more!

## Installation/Usage

You can install this package using a virtual environment of your choice.

Using venv:
```
pip install funky-fortune
```
Using pipenv:
```
pipenv shell
pipenv install funky-fortune
```

Then, import the package in your program:

```

### The functions currently implemented are listed below:

`zodiac_fortune(zodiac_sign)`

Takes a str as an argument, returns a str. If the string passed in corresponds to a zodiac sign, the fortune returned will be unique to that sign.

`lucky_number(name)`

Takes a str as an argument, returns an int. If the same name is passed in, the lucky number will stay the same.

`fortune_cookie(lucky=False)`

Returns a string. If the lucky parameter is passed in, the resulting fortune will be extra lucky!

`magic_8ball(question)`

Takes a str as an argument, returns a str. The magic eight ball will repeat the question, and return a random answer.
