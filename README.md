An exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Project Description 
ASCII ZOO is a small silly python package that prints ASCII animal art based on certain user inputs. Watch out for the interrupting cow... (It appears randomly). 

ASCII Zoo allows you to:
1. **Print Art Animal**: Displays ASCII art of the animal along with its name.
2. **Animal Sounds**: Outputs the corresponding sound after printing the ASCII animal.
3. **Surprise Cow**: Randomly shows up with an ASCII art representation and a “moo”.
4. **Wrong Output**: Handles unrecognized animal names, confirming wrong input with a playful response.

## How this package was created

1. Add structure of our file here. Explain each line.

## How to install and use this package
### Prerequisites
- **Python** (version 3.6 or later)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **pipenv** (for managing virtual environments)

Coming Soon...

### Installation

   

## How to run unit tests
Test are included within the 'test' directory. To run these test...
1. Install pytest in a virtual enviorment
2. Run the test from the main project directory: 'python3 -m pytest'

## Pro tip

Coming soon...

## Continuous integration

This project uses a continuous integration workflow that builds and runs unit tests automatically with every _push_ of the code to GitHub.
