## System Setup and Environment Configuration Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Python** (version 3.6 or later)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **pipenv** (for managing virtual environments)

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytarot.git
   cd pytarot
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment with Pipenv**: Initialize a virtual environment and install dependencies in editable mode:

   ```shell
   pipenv install -e .
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Start the virtual environment created by `pipenv`:

   ```shell
   pipenv shell
   ```

4. **Running the Package**  
You can run individual functions directly in the Python interactive shell or use the `main.py` script.

   **Running Functions in Python Shell**  
   Open the Python shell:

   ```shell
   python
   ```

5. **Import and test the package functions**:
   link to a test python file that use all the functions: ./src/pytarot/test.py

   ```python
   from pytarot import get_answers_of_wisdom, get_lucky_day, get_true_lover, get_positive_action

   print(answersofwisdom.get_answers_of_wisdom())
   print(luckyday.get_lucky_day())
   print(truelover.get_true_lover())
   print(positive_action.get_positive_message())
   ```

6. **Running `main.py`**  
Alternatively, you can execute the `main.py` file to run the package as a script:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

7. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**  
When you’re done, exit the `pipenv` shell:

   ```shell
   exit
   ```

8. **How to Run Unit Tests**  
Unit tests are located in the `test` directory and can be run using `pytest`.

   **Install pytest** (if not already installed in the virtual environment):

   ```shell
   pipenv install pytest
   ```

9. **Run Tests**: Run all tests from the main project directory:

   ```shell
   python -m pytest
   ```

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytarot.git
   cd pytarot
   ```
3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment with Pipenv**: Install all dependencies in editable mode:

   ```shell
   pipenv install -e .
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   ```shell
